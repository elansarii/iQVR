## <span style="color: #d7827e;">Milestone 1: Ideation & Modeling</span>

---

### <span style="color: #d7827e;">Ideation:</span>
- **Extracting Requirements:**  
  - Carefully analyzed and extracted both functional and non-functional requirements.
  
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - List of system features and behaviors required for operation.

---
- **Non-Functional Requirements:**
  - System performance, security, scalability, and usability standards.

- **Use Case Specification:**  
  - Defined the use cases for the critical parts of the program.

---

### <span style="color: #d7827e;">Modeling:</span>

- **Level 0 and 1 Data Flow Diagrams (DFD):**  
  - Created clear and detailed DFDs to visualize the data processing within the system at a high level.

- **Use Case Diagram:**  
  - Developed a diagram to capture the interactions between users and the system.

- **Class Diagram:**  
  - Designed a cohesive and maintainable class diagram.

---

## <span style="color: #d7827e;">Milestone 2: Planning & Implementation</span>

---

### <span style="color: #d7827e;">Planning:</span>

- **Sequence Diagram:**  
  - Designed a sequence diagram to detail the flow of the systemâ€™s interactions.

- **Identifying Key Features:**  
  - Determined core features and functionalities required for successful implementation.

---

### <span style="color: #d7827e;">Implementation:</span>

- **Use Case Implementation (Java & JavaFX):**  
  - Developed the program's use cases using Java and JavaFX for front-end development.

- **Styling with CSS:**  
  - Applied CSS to enhance the visual appeal and improve the user experience.

- **Icons Integration:**  
  - Integrated free-to-use icons to increase visual clarity and improve interface intuitiveness.

---

### <span style="color: #d7827e;">Potential Improvements in Implementation:</span>

1. **SQL Database Integration:**
   - **Improve Data Reliability:** Replace file-based storage with an SQL database (e.g., Oracle DB) for persistent, secure data storage and scalable data management.

2. **Enhanced Visual Libraries:**
   - Use advanced JavaFX libraries like **JFoenix** or **ControlsFX** to achieve a modern and polished design with better UI controls and visuals.

3. **UI/UX Enhancements:**
   - Implement responsive design and intuitive navigation.

---

### <span style="color: #d7827e;">Testing:</span>
1. **Tested Functional Features:**
    - Ensured the functionality of the GUI.
    - Tested for correct output and invoices.
2. **Testing Non-Functional Features:**
    - Tested the portability of the program.

---

## <span style="color: #d7827e;">Challenges & Outcomes</span>

---

### <span style="color: #d7827e;">Challenges:</span>
- **Modern Design with FX Libraries:**  
  - Faced difficulties in using FX libraries.

- **Scene Builder Issues:**  
  - Encountered limitations with Scene Builder.

- **Class Responsibility Distribution:**  
  - Struggled with effectively assigning responsibilities.

- **Issues with Dataflow Diagram:**  
  - Too complicated to read/do.  
  - Doesn't provide much information on the system.

---

### <span style="color: #d7827e;">Outcomes:</span>

- **Chatbots Are Impressive (Not Really):**
  - Helpful to get things initiated.  
  - A good friend to talk to.  
  - Very annoying.

- **Got a Peek of What's to Come:**  
  - Gained insight into how software is developed.  
  - Learned project management tools.
