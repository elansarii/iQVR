## **Milestone 1: Ideation & Modeling**

### **Ideation:**
- **Extracting Requirements:**  
  - Carefully analyzed and extracted both functional and non-functional requirements from the project documentation.
  
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - List of system features and behaviors required for operation.

- **Non-Functional Requirements:**
  - System performance, security, scalability, and usability standards.

- **Use Case Specification:**  
  - Defined the use cases for the critical parts of the program to ensure clear understanding of user interactions.

---

### **Modeling:**

- **Level 0 and 1 Data Flow Diagrams (DFD):**  
  - Created clear and detailed DFDs to visualize the data processing within the system at a high level.

- **Use Case Diagram:**  
  - Developed a diagram to capture the interactions between users and the system.

- **Class Diagram:**  
  - Designed a cohesive and maintainable class diagram.

---

## **Milestone 2: Planning & Implementation**

### **Planning:**

- **Sequence Diagram:**  
  - Designed a sequence diagram to detail the flow of the systemâ€™s interactions, focusing on the order of operations.

- **Identifying Key Features:**  
  - Determined core features and functionalities required for successful implementation.

---

### **Implementation:**

- **Use Case Implementation (Java & JavaFX):**  
  - Developed the program's use cases using Java and JavaFX for frontend development, focusing on clean user interfaces.

- **Styling with CSS:**  
  - Applied CSS to enhance the visual appeal and improve the user experience.

- **Icons Integration:**  
  - Integrated free-to-use icons to increase visual clarity and improve interface intuitiveness.

---

### **Potential Improvements in Implementation:**

1. **SQL Database Integration:**
   - **Improve Data Reliability:** Replace file-based storage with an SQL database (e.g., Oracle DB) for persistent, secure data storage and scalable data management.

2. **Enhanced Visual Libraries:**
   - Use advanced JavaFX libraries like **JFoenix** or **ControlsFX** to achieve a modern and polished design with better UI controls and visuals.

3. **UI/UX Enhancements:**
   - Implement responsive design, intuitive navigation.

---

### **Testing:**
1. Tested functional features
    - Ensured functionality of GUI
    - Tested for correct output and invoices
2. Testing non-functional features
    - Tested portability of the program

## **Challenges & Outcomes**

### **Challenges:**
- **Modern Design with FX Libraries:**  
  - Faced difficulties in using FX libraries

- **Scene Builder Issues:**  
  - Encountered limitations with Scene Builder

- **Class Responsibility Distribution:**  
  - Struggled with effectively assigning responsibilities


### **Outcomes:**
- **Chat bots are impressive (not really):**
  - Helpful to get things initiated
  - A good friend to talk
  - Very annoying
