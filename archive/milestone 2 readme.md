# Project
 
The project is all about creating a system (IQVR) that provides servicees for both vehicle owner or police officers. 2 members of the team worked creating a sequence diagram where they used StarUML to implement the diagrams for 2 use cases from milestone 1. The 2 other members worked on implementing 2 use cases (Transfer registered vehicle, Report accident) using JavaFX to design the program and IntelliJ as an IDE.
 
## Team
 
- Mohamed Elansari me2209852@qu.edu.qa
- Yazan Mohammad Alsaleh ys2110319@qu.edu.qa
- Ahmad Almashhadani aa2203014@qu.edu.qa 
- Hamza Aljaji ha2205541@qu.edu.qa
 
## Challenges
 
1. How to do the testing process for both functional and non-functional requirements, as  team members who are working on the testing part did not have enough knowledge from just one lab session to cover the testing.
2. How to create a sequence diagram for a intermediate to a big use-case.
3. Using StarUML to create a sequence diagram was a bit challenging as we were more used to use 
Visual Paradigm in the lab.
 
## Lessons
 
1. How to create a better and more modern user interface for the program from other engineers on the internet.
2. Working simultaneously on the project (everyone working on his task) Significantly increase productivity.
 
## Issues
 
1. We encountered an issue while attempting to run the program on Kali Linux within a virtual machine.
2. How to add the non-functional pictuers to the testing-non-functional.md file.
3. It was a bit hard to make meetings for all the group members at the same time.
