| **Complexity**                 | DFDs can be intricate to design, often requiring significant effort to fully represent processes and flows.                                                 | Class diagrams are generally less complex and more straightforward to design as they focus on static structures.                                                      |
| **Readability**                | DFDs may be challenging to interpret, especially in complex systems, as they can become cluttered and difficult to follow.                                  | Class diagrams are usually more readable and easier to understand due to their structured layout of classes and relationships.                                        |
| **Scope Limitation**           | While DFDs provide a view of data flow, they may lack a comprehensive overview of the entire system’s structure and behavior.                               | Class diagrams provide a clear depiction of the system’s structure and the relationships between different components but do not focus on data flow.                  |
| **Database Design Usefulness** | DFDs are advantageous when designing databases, as they effectively capture data inputs, outputs, and processes, making them helpful for database modeling. | Class diagrams are useful in representing the schema of a database in terms of classes/entities, attributes, and relationships but do not detail the data processing. |
