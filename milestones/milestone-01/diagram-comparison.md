## DFD
- **Complexity**: DFDs can be intricate to design, often requiring significant effort to fully represent processes and flows.
- **Readability**: DFDs may be challenging to interpret, especially in complex systems, as they can become cluttered and difficult to follow.
- **Scope Limitation**: While DFDs provide a view of data flow, they may lack a comprehensive overview of the entire systemâ€™s structure and behavior.
- **Database Design Usefulness**: DFDs are advantageous when designing databases, as they effectively capture data inputs, outputs, and processes, making them helpful for database modeling.
