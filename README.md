# Project
 
The project is about developing an online system called IQVR, 
the system has a couple of main functions such as registering a car, 
transferring a car from one owner to another, or paying the violation invoices. 
It also provides some important functionalities for the police department as it gives the police officer the ability to make a confiscating order for the violated vehicle. 
First, we had to go through the background of the project and gather the requirements for each section. Second, we made use cases and functions for each of the 5 sections. 
Third, we started implementing the diagrams such as DFD and use case. Fourth, each member started reviewing each other job and giving feedback or editing the work for a better result.

## Challenges
 
1. Classes and Methods: There was a bit of difficulty in assigning some methods to the right classes, as a method can be assigned to one class rather than another.
2. Vehicle Fitness Certificate: It was slightly challenging to gain more information about the vehicle fitness certificate and add it to the technical section. So we had to read between the lines and ask for more details from the Lab doctor.
3. Using StarUML instead of Visual Paradigm: After using Visual Paradigm and StarUML during the Lab sessions we decided to use StarUML over Visual Paradigm, as it is easier to navigate, has faster response, and simplified design with better UI/UX.
4. Editing the same file simultaneously on Github: Working on a specific file at the same time can lead to overwritten changes and complete data loss if the time of modifications is not managed correctly between our group members.
5. Balancing project requirements alongside other projects: Doing this project with such requirements while having other CS projects, and mid-terms, and on top of that each group member can have a  different semester classes schedule, so we had to prioritize tasks.
6. How to do the testing process for both functional and non-functional requirements, as  team members who are working on the testing part did not have enough knowledge from just one lab session to cover the testing.
7. How to create a sequence diagram for a intermediate to a big use-case.
8. Using StarUML to create a sequence diagram was a bit challenging as we were more used to use Visual Paradigm in the lab.
 
## Lessons
 
1. Clear communication is a must: In such a project (medium to big) communicating in a clear way, is really important as it reduces wasted time and increases productivity, and regular check-ins such as Discord, WhatsApp, and Notion.
2. Embracing adaptability: Project tasks can not always go as planned or a member can get unaccepted feedback from others, so you need to be able to adapt to changes in the project and in a quick way, to get the expected final quality. 
3. GitHub for version control: GitHub enabled us to contribute to the project on the same version, instead of having many different versions which can be overwhelming.
4. How to create a better and more modern user interface for the program from other engineers on the internet.
5. Working simultaneously on the project (everyone working on his task) Significantly increase productivity.
 
## Issues

1. We encountered an issue while attempting to run the program on Kali Linux within a virtual machine.
2. How to add the non-functional pictuers to the testing-non-functional.md file.
3. It was a bit hard to make meetings for all the group members at the same time.
